# Extension compatibility configuration for Open WebUI
# This file defines how extensions can be combined together
version: "1.0"

# Extension groups - extensions in the same group conflict with each other
# Only one extension from each group can be used in a combination
groups:
  tts:
    description: "Text-to-Speech services (mutually exclusive)"
    extensions:
      - openai-edge-tts
      - openedai-speech

# Global conflicts (beyond groups)
# Extensions listed here cannot be used together regardless of groups
conflicts:
  # Currently no additional conflicts beyond groups
  # Example:
  # - [extension1, extension2]

# Valid combinations (if not specified, all non-conflicting combinations are generated)
# This section explicitly defines which combinations should be created
